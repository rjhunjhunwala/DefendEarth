## Defend Earth
### Nick Villano
Here is a little game I created called Defend Earth. It is a simple 2D game that uses a graphics engine which I also made from scratch. 

The goal is to use your jet shoot down as many of the invading spaceships that come down from the sky as you can. Don't worry if any of them get by you. You will gain a point for every one you shoot down and lose a point for every one that gets by. The game ends when one of the invaders hits your ship with theirs.

A demo can be found at https://youtu.be/PtBwIryOSWw

To play the game, download the repository as a .zip and run the file DefendEarth-master/NetBeansProjects/DefendEarth DefendEarth.jar
